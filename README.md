# Nick Lennon - Drummer

Nick Lennon (from here on will be referred to as the “client”) is a musician who offers services, including live music performance, recording sessions and tutoring, to all clients who have an interest in creating, listening to or learning how to play live music. This website is based on my own previous work before taking up coding as it is an area I am very familiar with and completely understand the needs of the client and the user.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements of this project are to create a responsive website with a minimum of three pages using HTML5 and CSS3.
