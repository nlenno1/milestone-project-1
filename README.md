# Nick Lennon - Drummer

Nick Lennon (from here on will be referred to as the “client”) is a musician who offers services, including live music performance, recording sessions and tutoring, to all clients who have an interest in creating, listening to or learning how to play live music. This website is based on my own previous work before taking up coding as it is an area I am very familiar with and completely understand the needs of the client and the user.

This is the first of four Milestone Projects that make up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements of this project are to create a responsive website with a minimum of three pages using HTML5 and CSS3.

## UX
### Project Goals

* To make it easy for users to navigate and access all the information they need.
* To allow users to learn more about the client and their experience.

### Business Goals
- Increase social media following
- Improve user engagement with the brand
- Attract new students
- Encourage musicians and recruiters to get in touch about future work projects

### User Stories
* As a potential student, I want to find information on the client’s lessons, the client’s experience, see previous student testimonials and view examples of the lesson content to help me establish if the client is a good teacher, to encourage me to get in touch if I have any questions and to sign up for lessons
* As a musician/potential collaborator, I want to see the client’s previous work/performances, experience, training and client’s testimonials to allow me to decide if I want to work with them in the future and then to find easy ways to contact them.
* As a fan who saw the client perform, I want to find more information about the client including what their latest music or video is, pictures of client and pervious performances, links to clients current projects, when their next show is, links to buy tickets and to connect with their social networks.
* As an agent/recruiter/potential employer, I want to see information about the client’s training and experience as well as be able to view performances to establish the client’s playing ability and then download the latest version of their basic CV before having an easy way to get in touch.
